# # Project Overview

This project is focused on creating a promotional website for the popular Uno card game. The website will serve as an online platform to introduce the game, provide information about its features, and encourage players to try it. The site will be developed by us, some students from DAW in collaboration with students from UPC, who are responsible for the game's development.

# # Purpose of the Website

The main goal of the website is to promote the Uno game, providing users with essential information about the game, its rules, and how to play. The website will also serve as a central hub for people to learn more about the game and its digital version, with links to download or access it, depending on the platform.

# # Target Audience

The website is aimed at a broad audience, especially fans of casual, easy-to-learn games like Uno. It targets players of all ages, from newcomers to experienced Uno players, as well as those looking for fun, social games to play with friends and family.
